			<h1>About SquareOne Music & Lessons</h1>
			<p>Established in 1989, <strong>SquareOne Music & Lessons</strong> with the sole mission of spreading our love and passion of music.  Our founder, John Smith, grew up with a strong passion for music that was enstilled in him by his parents.  He eventually was moved to start a band and recorded many records that went on to win awards, he toured with his band for over a decade.  But his passion was always to start a music store to encourage others to pursue their musical dreams.</p>
		 
			<p>We would like you to join us in John's mission by using the services we provide.  Our instructors have been working diligently to provide a wonderful learning experience.  <a href="rentals.html">Rentals</a> are a provided for almost all of our instruments and we offer payment plans for purchasing instruments.  We also offer just about any accessories needed for all instruments, if we don't have it in our store we will find it for you.</p>
