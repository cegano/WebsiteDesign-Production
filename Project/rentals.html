			<h1>Instrument Rental or Purchase</h1>
			<p>SquareOne Music & Lessons is one of the largest providers of musical instrument rental in the U.S.  <strong>Educator-approved and trusted by teachers</strong>, we have over 300 retail and affiliate locations with more than 150 educational representatives servicing schools across the country.</p>
			
			<p>Renting an instrument is a great way for you or your child to try an instrument without needing to make a substantial up-front investment.  If your child outgrows the instrument, changes to another instrument or it's time to upgrade past the beginner model, you can <strong>exchange</strong> your child's instrument for one of equal or greater value.</p>
			
			<p>SquareOne Music & Lessons provides customers with several options with every instrument we carry.  You can rent-to-own or purchase with in-store options and services.  We also provide delivery for instruments and accessories for your convenience.  Fill out our <a href="lessons.html">customer information form</a> for more information or come to one of our locations today!</p>

			<h2>Exchange</h2>
			<img class="home" src="exchange.jpg" alt="" />
			<p>With our rental program you get the chance to try it out without committing to a purchase. If you decide later it's not your instrument, you may exchange it for another instrument of equal or greater value throughout the life of the agreement!</p>

			<h2>Upgrade</h2>
			<img class="home" src="stages.jpg" alt="" />
			<p>Beginner level instruments are a lot like “easy mode” in a video game. When you upgrade, a step-up instrument is “intermediate” and professional instruments are for “experts.” If a student has truly mastered the beginner level instrument, then a step-up instrument is the next move.</p>
